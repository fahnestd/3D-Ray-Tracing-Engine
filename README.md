A simple ray tracing engine implemented in C# using Windows Forms for visualization. This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of ray tracing including ray generation, camera systems, and basic geometry intersection.

Testing out using distance based fog, we can see a line strip being rendered from 1 mesh with 4 vertices. the 2 opposing corners of the square are closer to the camera; creating the gradient effect we see. The white represents areas closer to the camera.

Example screenshot of a triangle being rendered. The shadow is caused by a view distance fog effect and the top of the triangle tilts towards the camera.
